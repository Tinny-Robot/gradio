1. **Auto Release Notes** ü§ñ: We've created a new system for automatically tracking the changes that go
    into new releases. On every pull request commit,
    a github action will check whether the `website/CHANGELOG.md` file has been updated with a line containing a brief summary
    of the change and associated pull request number. This check can be skipped if the `no-changelog-update` label is added
    to the PR.

# Version 3.3

Here's what's new in gradio `v3.3`:

## 1. Iterative Outputs ‚è≥  

You can now create an iterative output simply by having your function return a generator!

Here's (part of) an example that was used to generate the interface below it. [See full code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9bWS6B82CT7bw-m4L6AJR8za7fEK7Ov?usp=sharing).

```python
def predict(steps, seed):
    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed)
    for i in range(1,steps):
        yield pipeline(generator=generator, num_inference_steps=i)["sample"][0]
```

## 2. Accordion Layout üÜï 

This version of Gradio introduces a new layout component to Blocks: the Accordion. Wrap your elements in a neat, expandable layout that allows users to toggle them as needed. 

Usage: ([Read the docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#accordion))

```python
with gr.Accordion("open up"):
   # components here 
```

## 3. Skops Integration üìà 

Our new integration with [skops](https://huggingface.co/blog/skops) allows you to load tabular classification and regression models directly from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models). 

Here's a classification example showing how quick it is to set up an interface for a [model](https://huggingface.co/scikit-learn/tabular-playground).

```python
import gradio as gr
gr.Interface.load("models/scikit-learn/tabular-playground").launch()
```
